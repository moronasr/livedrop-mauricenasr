# Shoplite Knowledge Base (RAG)

## Document 1: User Registration & Account Management
Shoplite lets users register as buyers or sellers. To create an account, users provide an email, a strong password (min 12 characters), and a display name. A verification email is sent and must be confirmed within 24 hours; otherwise the account remains inactive. Passwords are hashed with a modern algorithm and never stored in plain text. Two-factor authentication (2FA) via authenticator app is optional at signup and can be enabled later from Account → Security. Profile data includes country, language, and notification preferences. Users may delete their account at any time from Account → Privacy; deletion queues a 7-day grace period during which a user can cancel the request. Seller upgrades require business details (legal name, tax ID) and acceptance of the Seller Agreement. If a user forgets their password, the reset flow sends a time-boxed link (15 minutes) to the verified email. Support can assist with locked accounts after identity verification.

## Document 2: Product Search, Filters & Typeahead
Shoplite offers keyword search with real-time typeahead suggestions. Results can be filtered by category, price range, condition, shipping time, and seller rating. The “In-stock only” toggle hides out-of-stock listings. Sorting options include relevance (default), newest, price low→high, and rating. Typeahead surfaces popular queries and category matches after two characters; suggestions are localized per user language and region. For accessibility, keyboard users can navigate suggestions with ↑/↓ and Enter. Synonym expansion (e.g., “hoodie” ≈ “sweatshirt”) improves recall while preserving precision with field boosts to titles over descriptions. When multiple words are typed, the engine prioritizes phrase matches. Search history is stored locally for guests and on the server for signed-in users, so recent searches sync across devices.

## Document 3: Cart & Checkout Overview
The cart supports items from multiple sellers. Users can adjust quantities, remove items, and save for later. Taxes and shipping are estimated per item; totals update instantly. During checkout, Shoplite supports cards, Apple/Google Pay (where available), and gift codes. Address book entries can be edited or added on the fly; the default address is preselected. Fraud safeguards include CVV and address verification (AVS). Discounts apply before tax; only one promo code is active per order unless noted. If an item goes out of stock during checkout, the system alerts the user and removes the item from the order; other items proceed. Orders move to “Processing” once payment is authorized, then “Shipped” after carrier handoff. Users receive email confirmations and can find invoices under Orders → Details. Refunds are issued to the original payment method.

## Document 4: Shipping & Delivery
Shoplite offers Standard and Express shipping. Cut-off for same-day handoff is 3pm local warehouse time; orders after cut-off ship next business day. Estimated delivery shows on the product page and at checkout based on destination, carrier SLA, and inventory location. A tracking link is emailed when the label is created and updates as the carrier scans the parcel; some carriers show “pre-transit” for several hours. Signature may be required for high-value orders; users can opt in at checkout where available. If the carrier marks a parcel delivered but the user cannot locate it, support asks for a neighbor check and 24-hour wait (porch theft false positives are common). After that, we open a carrier investigation and proceed per outcome. Split shipments can occur for multi-item orders; each shipment has its own tracking and may arrive on different days. Shipping fees are calculated per shipment after discounts and before tax. We do not ship to PO boxes for oversized items. International shipments may incur customs delays outside our control.

## Document 5: Returns & Refunds
Most items are eligible for return within 30 days of delivery. Returned items must be unused, in original packaging, with all accessories. Some categories (perishables, digital goods, hygiene items) are non-returnable and are clearly labeled on the product page. Users initiate a return from Orders → Details; a prepaid label is provided when the reason qualifies for free returns. Otherwise, the label cost is deducted from the refund. Once the carrier scans the return, the order status shows “In return transit.” Upon arrival at the returns center, inspection usually completes within 2–5 business days. Approved returns trigger a refund to the original payment method; processing time depends on the bank (typically 3–7 business days). Exchanges are processed as a new order after the refund. If an item arrives damaged or incorrect, users should select the corresponding reason to prioritize the case. Abuse of returns (excessive wear, missing parts) may lead to partial refunds or denial per policy.

## Document 6: Payments & Wallets
Shoplite accepts major cards and, where supported, Apple Pay and Google Pay. Card payments use CVV and Address Verification (AVS). For risk management, we may place a temporary authorization up to the order amount; the final capture occurs when the first shipment leaves the warehouse. Gift codes apply before tax and shipping; only one code is allowed unless a promotion explicitly allows stacking. If a payment fails, users can retry a different method from the checkout screen; frequent failures may trigger a fraud check and temporary hold. Saved payment methods are tokenized by our PCI-compliant provider; the platform never stores full card numbers. Refunds return to the original method; if a card is closed, banks typically route the funds to the associated account automatically. Partial shipments create partial captures and partial refunds when applicable. Wallet availability varies by device and region.

## Document 7: Discounts & Promo Codes
Promotional codes are entered at checkout and apply to eligible items only. Codes generally cannot be combined; if multiple are entered, the best value is automatically applied and others are saved for later. Discounts calculate before tax and shipping. Some codes require a minimum subtotal after other discounts. Category or brand exclusions are disclosed in the promo details. Percentage codes cap at a maximum discount amount where noted. Expired or region-restricted codes are rejected with a message explaining why. Gift cards are not discounted. If a code is used on an order that is later partially returned, the refund reflects the proportionally reduced price. Abusive behavior (multi-account or self-referral misuse) may result in code invalidation or account review. Limited-time sitewide sales may auto-apply without a code; the banner indicates timing and terms.

## Document 8: Notifications
Users receive email confirmations for order placement, shipment, delivery, and refunds. Push notifications are available on iOS/Android when enabled under Account → Notifications. For each channel, users can toggle Marketing, Product Updates, and Transactional alerts. Transactional emails (receipts, password resets, critical policy updates) cannot be fully disabled due to legal obligations. Delivery push alerts rely on carrier webhooks; if a carrier does not support timely events, we fall back to daily polling which may delay notifications. Undeliverable emails (bounces) automatically disable the address until the user edits it. Notification history appears in Account → Notifications → History for 30 days. We localize content to the user’s language where available.

## Document 9: Seller Onboarding
Creators upgrading to seller accounts provide legal business name, tax ID (e.g., EIN/VAT), payout banking details, and a support email. They must accept the Seller Agreement and Listing Policy. Identity verification may require a government ID and live selfie; verification typically completes within hours but can take up to 2 business days. Payouts are weekly by default with a minimum threshold; disputes or chargebacks can delay payouts until resolution. Sellers configure shipping profiles (regions, rates, handling time) and return policies (window, conditions). Account health shows late shipment rate, cancellation rate, and dispute rate; poor health can limit visibility until metrics recover. Sellers are responsible for accurate listings, timely fulfillment, and responsive support.

## Document 10: Listing Policy
Listings must accurately describe the product, including condition (new/used/refurbished), size, and materials. Images must be original or licensed, with no watermarks or contact info. Prohibited items include illegal goods, weapons, counterfeit products, and items that infringe intellectual property. Age-restricted products must follow local laws. Titles should be concise and avoid keyword stuffing; metadata must not mislead. Variants (size/color) must be correctly grouped. Manipulating reviews or creating duplicate listings to game search is prohibited. Violations may result in removal, visibility suppression, or account action. Repeat offenses escalate to suspension.

## Document 11: Ratings & Reviews Policy
Only users who purchased an item can leave a review. Reviews should focus on product quality, fit, or shipping experience; hate speech, doxxing, and explicit content are prohibited. We use automated filters to detect spam, profanity, and off-topic content; flagged reviews enter manual moderation. Sellers may respond publicly to reviews but cannot offer incentives for positive feedback. Users can edit or delete their own reviews within 30 days. Reviews removed for policy violations do not count toward ratings. Aggregate ratings use a weighted average that discounts outliers and suspected spam.

## Document 12: Disputes & Chargebacks
When problems arise, users should contact the seller first through the order page. If not resolved within 3 business days, they can escalate to Shoplite Support. We may request photos, tracking, or correspondence as evidence. For non-delivery, we verify carrier status and address accuracy; for not-as-described, we review listing photos and messages. Chargebacks opened with the bank pause our internal process; we submit evidence on the user’s behalf and wait for the card network decision. Abuse (false claims, item-not-received after delivery confirmation) can lead to account restrictions. Throughout the case, refunds or replacements are issued per policy and evidence.

## Document 13: Privacy & Data
We collect only data necessary to provide the service: account details, orders, payment tokens, device information, and support messages. Personal data is processed under legitimate interest or consent as required by law. Users can request data export or deletion from Account → Privacy. Deletion removes personal identifiers but may retain aggregated order metrics for auditing. We do not sell personal data. Third-party processors (payments, email, analytics) are bound by data-processing agreements. We store data in encrypted databases and encrypt network traffic. Retention periods vary (e.g., order records retained for tax compliance).

## Document 14: Security & 2FA
We recommend enabling two-factor authentication using an authenticator app. Session management includes device recognition and the ability to sign out of other sessions. Passwords must be at least 12 characters and are hashed with a modern algorithm and per-user salt. Admin access uses hardware keys and privileged-access reviews. Suspicious login activity triggers alerts and, in some cases, temporary holds until the user verifies the activity. We perform regular security testing and apply critical patches promptly. Users should avoid sharing one-time codes with anyone claiming to be support.

## Document 15: Taxes & VAT
Taxes are estimated at checkout based on destination, item category, and seller nexus. For international orders, import duties or VAT may be collected at checkout where we support Delivered-Duty-Paid; otherwise, the carrier may collect on delivery. Invoices with VAT breakdowns are available under Orders → Details after shipment. Sellers are responsible for configuring tax settings where required. Gift cards are typically not taxed when purchased but are taxed when redeemed on taxable items.
